/// {@template synchronized_lock}
/// A reentrant async lock for critical section execution.
///
/// This class serializes access to an async [FutureOr] function
/// by maintaining a queue. Reentrancy is supported within the same [Zone].
///
/// Features:
/// - Queue-based task execution for `synchronizedAsync`
/// - Reentrancy (based on Dart zones) for both `synchronized` and `synchronizedAsync`
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final lock = SynchronizedLock();
///
/// await lock.synchronizedAsync(() async {
///   // Only one async block can execute here at a time
/// });
///
/// lock.synchronized(() {
///   // Only one sync block can execute here at a time,
///   // and it will not queue if another zone holds the lock.
/// });
/// ```
/// {@endtemplate}
class SynchronizedLock {
  final List<_LockRequest> _queue = []; // Using List as a simple queue
  bool _isLocked = false; // Indicates if the lock is currently held
  Zone? _currentLockingZone; // The Zone that currently holds the lock
  int _reentrantCount = 0; // How many times the current Zone has re-entered

  /// {@template synchronized_lock_synchronized_async}
  /// Executes the [action] within an asynchronous synchronized block.
  ///
  /// Only one [action] may execute at a time per lock. If the current [Zone]
  /// has already acquired the lock, the function is treated as reentrant and allowed.
  /// Otherwise, the action is queued and executed when the lock becomes available.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// await lock.synchronizedAsync(() async {
  ///   // Do something asynchronous
  /// });
  /// ```
  /// {@endtemplate}
