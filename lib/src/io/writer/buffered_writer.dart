import 'writer.dart';

/// {@template buffered_writer}
/// Writes text to a character-output stream, buffering characters to provide
/// efficient writing of characters, arrays, and strings.
/// 
/// The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be used. The
/// default is large enough for most purposes.
/// 
/// ## Example Usage
/// ```dart
/// // Basic buffered writing
/// final buffered = BufferedWriter(FileWriter('output.txt'));
/// try {
///   await buffered.write('Hello, World!');
///   await buffered.writeLine('This is a new line.');
///   await buffered.flush();
/// } finally {
///   await buffered.close();
/// }
/// 
/// // Writing large amounts of data efficiently
/// final buffered = BufferedWriter(FileWriter('large_output.txt'), bufferSize: 65536);
/// try {
///   for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
///     await buffered.writeLine('Record $i: ${generateLargeString()}');
///   }
///   await buffered.flush();
/// } finally {
///   await buffered.close();
/// }
/// ```
