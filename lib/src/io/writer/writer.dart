/// {@template writer}
/// Abstract class for writing to character streams.
/// 
/// The only methods that a subclass must implement are [writeChar], [flush],
/// and [close]. Most subclasses, however, will override some of the methods
/// defined here in order to provide higher efficiency, additional functionality,
/// or both.
/// 
/// ## Design Philosophy
/// The [Writer] class provides a uniform interface for writing character data
/// to various destinations. Unlike [OutputStream] which deals with raw bytes,
/// [Writer] handles character encoding and provides text-oriented operations.
/// 
/// ## Example Usage
/// ```dart
/// // Writing to a file
/// final writer = FileWriter('output.txt');
/// try {
///   await writer.write('Hello, World!');
///   await writer.writeLine('This is a new line.');
///   await writer.flush();
/// } finally {
///   await writer.close();
/// }
/// 
/// // Writing with buffering for better performance
/// final bufferedWriter = BufferedWriter(FileWriter('large_output.txt'));
/// try {
///   for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
///     await bufferedWriter.writeLine('Line $i: Some content here');
///   }
///   await bufferedWriter.flush(); // Ensure all data is written
/// } finally {
///   await bufferedWriter.close();
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// {@endtemplate}
abstract class Writer implements Closeable, Flushable {
  /// {@macro writer}
  Writer();

  bool _closed = false;
  
  /// Returns `true` if this writer has been closed.
  bool get isClosed => _closed;
  
  /// Writes a single character.
  /// 
  /// The character to be written is contained in the 16 low-order bits of the
  /// given integer value; the 16 high-order bits are ignored.
  /// 
  /// ## Parameters
  /// - [c]: The character to write (only the low-order 16 bits are used)
  /// 
  /// ## Example
  /// ```dart
  /// final writer = FileWriter('output.txt');
  /// try {
  ///   await writer.writeChar(65); // Write 'A'
  ///   await writer.writeChar(66); // Write 'B'
  ///   await writer.writeChar(67); // Write 'C'
  ///   await writer.flush();
  /// } finally {
  ///   await writer.close();
  /// }
  /// ```
  /// 
  /// Throws [IOException] if an I/O error occurs.
  /// Throws [StreamClosedException] if the writer has been closed.
  Future<void> writeChar(int c);
  
  /// Writes an array of characters.
  /// 
  /// ## Parameters
  /// - [cbuf]: Array of characters to write
  /// - [offset]: Offset from which to start writing characters (default: 0)
  /// - [length]: Number of characters to write (default: remaining characters from offset)
  /// 
  /// ## Example
  /// ```dart
  /// final writer = FileWriter('output.txt');
  /// try {
  ///   final chars = 'Hello, World!'.codeUnits;
  ///   
  ///   // Write entire array
  ///   await writer.writeChars(chars);
  ///   
  ///   // Write part of array
  ///   await writer.writeChars(chars, 7, 5); // Write "World"
  ///   
  ///   await writer.flush();
  /// } finally {
  ///   await writer.close();
  /// }
  /// ```
  /// 
  /// Throws [InvalidArgumentException] if [offset] or [length] is negative, or if
  /// [offset] + [length] is greater than the length of [cbuf].
  /// Throws [IOException] if an I/O error occurs.
  /// Throws [StreamClosedException] if the writer has been closed.

  /// ## Parameters
  /// - [str]: String to write
  /// - [offset]: Offset from which to start writing characters (default: 0)

  /// 
  /// ## Example
  /// ```dart
  /// final writer = FileWriter('output.txt');
  /// try {
  ///   // Write entire string
  ///   await writer.write('Hello, World!');
  ///   
  ///   // Write part of string
  ///   await writer.write('Hello, World!', 7, 5); // Write "World"
  ///   
  ///   await writer.flush();
  /// } finally {
  ///   await writer.close();
  /// }
  /// ```
  /// 
  /// Throws [InvalidArgumentException] if [offset] or [length] is negative, or if

  /// Throws [IOException] if an I/O error occurs.

  /// Writes a line separator.
  /// 
  /// The line separator string is defined by the system property line.separator,

  ///   await writer.write('First line');
  ///   await writer.newLine();
  ///   await writer.write('Second line');

  /// ## Example
  /// ```dart
  /// final writer = FileWriter('output.txt');

  /// 
  /// ## Example
