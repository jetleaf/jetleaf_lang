/// {@template input_stream}
/// This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing an input
/// stream of bytes.
/// 
/// Applications that need to define a subclass of [InputStream] must always
/// provide a method that returns the next byte of input.
/// 
/// ## Design Philosophy
/// The [InputStream] class provides a uniform interface for reading data from
/// various sources such as files, network connections, or memory buffers.
/// It follows the decorator pattern, allowing streams to be wrapped with
/// additional functionality like buffering or filtering.
/// 
/// ## Example Usage
/// ```dart
/// // Reading from a file
/// final input = FileInputStream('data.bin');
/// try {
///   final buffer = Uint8List(1024);
///   int bytesRead;
///   while ((bytesRead = await input.read(buffer)) != -1) {
///     // Process the data in buffer[0..bytesRead-1]
///     processData(buffer.sublist(0, bytesRead));
///   }
/// } finally {
///   await input.close();
/// }
/// 
/// // Reading with buffering for better performance
/// final bufferedInput = BufferedInputStream(FileInputStream('large_file.bin'));
/// try {
///   final data = await bufferedInput.readFully(1024);
///   processData(data);
/// } finally {
///   await bufferedInput.close();
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// {@endtemplate}
abstract class InputStream implements Closeable {
  /// {@macro input_stream}
  InputStream();

  bool _closed = false;
  
  /// Returns `true` if this stream has been closed.
  bool get isClosed => _closed;
  
  /// Reads the next byte of data from the input stream.
  /// 
  /// The value byte is returned as an `int` in the range `0` to `255`.
  /// If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached,
  /// the value `-1` is returned.
  /// 
  /// This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream
  /// is detected, or an exception is thrown.
  /// 
  /// ## Returns
  /// The next byte of data, or `-1` if the end of the stream is reached.
  /// 
  /// ## Example
  /// ```dart
  /// final input = FileInputStream('data.txt');
  /// int byte;
  /// while ((byte = await input.readByte()) != -1) {
  ///   print('Read byte: $byte');
  /// }
  /// await input.close();
  /// ```
  /// 
  /// Throws [IOException] if an I/O error occurs.
  /// Throws [StreamClosedException] if the stream has been closed.
  Future<int> readByte();
  
  /// Reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into
  /// the buffer array [b].
  /// 
  /// The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method
  /// blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an
  /// exception is thrown.
  /// 
  /// If the length of [b] is zero, then no bytes are read and `0` is returned;
  /// otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is
  /// available because the stream is at the end of the file, the value `-1`
  /// is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into [b].
  /// 
  /// ## Parameters
  /// - [b]: The buffer into which the data is read
  /// - [offset]: The start offset in array [b] at which the data is written
  /// - [length]: The maximum number of bytes to read
  /// 
  /// ## Returns
  /// The total number of bytes read into the buffer, or `-1` if there is no
  /// more data because the end of the stream has been reached.
  /// 
  /// ## Example
  /// ```dart
  /// final input = FileInputStream('data.bin');
  /// final buffer = Uint8List(1024);
  /// 
  /// // Read up to 1024 bytes
  /// final bytesRead = await input.read(buffer);

  /// [offset] + [length] is greater than the length of [b].
  /// Throws [IOException] if an I/O error occurs.
